## 📦 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js (v18.x or later)
- PostgreSQL database
- Cloudinary Account (for hosting receipts and event banner images)

### 2. Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aayamtechfest/AayamTechfest.git
cd AayamTechfest
```

Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate the variables:
```env
# ─── Database (Supabase PostgreSQL Connection Pooling) ───
# Transaction pooler string pointing to port 6543 (used by Prisma at runtime)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.[username]:[password]@aws-0-[region].pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"

# Session mode connection string pointing directly to port 5432 (used by Prisma for migrations)
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres.[username]:[password]@aws-0-[region].pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"

# ─── Cloudinary SDK (Media Storage) ───
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloudinary-cloud-name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-cloudinary-api-key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-cloudinary-api-secret"

# ─── Email Configuration (Nodemailer + Gmail SMTP) ───
SMTP_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_EMAIL="aayamhackathon@gmail.com"
SMTP_PASSWORD="your_google_app_password_here"
SMTP_FROM_NAME="AAYAM Hackathon Team"

# ─── Admin Seed Account Default Credentials ───
ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@aayam.tech"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="your-strong-admin-password"

# ─── Session Configuration (iron-session) ───
# Must be a 32-character string
SESSION_SECRET="replace-with-a-32-character-session-secret"

# ─── Canonical Site URLs ───
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### 4. Database Setup & Seeding (Local Development)
Deploy database migrations:
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

Seed the default admin account, email templates, and sample events:
```bash
npm run seed
```

### 5. Running the Application
Run the local Next.js development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## 🔺 Production Deployment (Vercel + Supabase Serverless)

The project is fully optimized for Vercel serverless deployment using a pooled database connection architecture with Prisma and Supabase.

### Quick Setup Steps
1. **GitHub Repository**: Push your project repository to GitHub.
2. **Import to Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
3. **Environment Variables**: Configure the environment variables (such as `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET`, etc.) in Vercel project settings based on the `.env.example` template.
4. **Build & Development Settings**:
   - Framework Preset: `Next.js`
   - Build Command: `npm run vercel-build`
5. **Deploy**: Click Deploy. Vercel will automatically compile the codebase, run migrations, and serve the application.

For detailed, step-by-step guidance on setting up connection poolers, Resend verified domains, and Cloudinary storage, please refer to the complete [Vercel Production Deployment Guide](file:///home/md-warish-ansari/.gemini/antigravity/brain/6fa9ab1f-f42d-44c3-8a4a-7920e4edf12d/vercel_deployment_guide.md).

## 🐳 Production Deployment (Docker Compose Fallback)

If containerized local or self-hosted deployment is preferred, a production-ready `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` are also provided.

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- A fully populated `.env` file in the project root.

### Deploying the Stack
Simply run the following command in the root directory:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### What Happens Automatically?
1. Docker Compose builds the Next.js image using the production `Dockerfile`.
2. The PostgreSQL database service is launched. A container health check ensures it is accepting connections.
3. Once the database is online, the application container:
   - Synchronizes database schemas (`prisma db push`).
   - Runs database seeds (`prisma db seed`) to populate email templates, admin credentials, and default settings.
   - Starts the optimized production Next.js server on port `3000`.

To stop the deployment stack:
```bash
docker compose down
```

## 🔒 Security & Validations
- Backend validation ensures that payment registration rejections are accompanied by a descriptive message.
- Multi-step registration forms enforce appropriate team name requirements dynamically based on event configuration.
- Cascading deletion rules keep the database cleanly synchronized with remote media assets.
